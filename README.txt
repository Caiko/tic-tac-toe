# Tic Tac Toe Game ðŸŽ®

## Overview
This is a fully functional **Tic Tac Toe** game built using **React** with a stylish green-themed user interface.

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Includes modern JavaScript features like arrow functions and destructuring.

## Game Logic
The game board is represented by a 3x3 grid. Each player takes turns clicking on an empty square to place their symbol ("X" or "O"). The game checks for a winner after every move by comparing the current state of the game board against all possible winning combinations (rows, columns, diagonals). The game also checks for a draw when all squares are filled without a winner.
